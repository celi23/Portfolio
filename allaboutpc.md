During the summer of 2020, in the midst of COVID, I started looking into a PC. Because of my growing interest in gaming and my dying laptop, I started research into the components of a PC. However, I have found it very difficult to gather enough information that I need to figure out PCs. Like, what is a CPU or a GPU? Why are GPUs so expensive? Is AMD better or Intel better?

Hence, I came up with this project! A website that informs the user all about PCs. This website was designed specifically for people who have just started looking into it. It provides a wikipedia that shows different components of a PC. It also includes a platform where the user can communicate and ask questions. Using CSS, HTML, and React, I have sucessfully created a website on my local server that includes React animations and user authentification. Below is a video I made about this website!
