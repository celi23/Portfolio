The project focuses on creating a underwater robot that can detect depth using sonar. With that data, GPS, and thermistor, the team's goal was to produce a map of the ocean at deployment with its depth and temperature. 

The team first brainstormed the placement of each of the sensors. In our discussion, we decided on using a long PVC pipe that is submerged in water to hold the sonar using piezo transducers. On top of the robot sits the GPS and the temperature sensor. The speacker that produces the sonar has to sit lower than the mic and pointed down using a 3D modeled tube so the mic does not pick up on the somar right away, but listens to it as the sonar bounces back.
